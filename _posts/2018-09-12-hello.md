# Welcome!

So... again, welcome to my new website. My name is Alan Rynne, I am an Architectural Engineer & Computational Specialist with a **BIG** crush on efficiency, not only on the design phase (structural behaviour, constructability) but also concerned on how to improve our workflows in the AEC industry.

In this blog I will be writing about many topics that I ***LOVE***, mainly centered in:

* Architectural Design
* Programming
* Architectural Geometry
* Technological Improvements in Architecture

although other less serious topics might be introduced too! I will also try to introduce some guides for useful tools & workflows that I use on a daily basis, which will be found in [Series](/series)

I am a huge fan of Open Source code, so I usually have all my code projects on [my Github page](https://github.com/AlanRynne) (which is also where this page is hosted!). 

Please be indulgent if the some projects are a mess, are badly documented, or don't work at all!! And if so, you can always [write me an email](mailto:alan@rynne.es) or open a new issue on the corresponding GitHub Repo. I will do my best to help in any matter!

If after reading this, you feel like you want to contribute or collaborate in any manner, then we most definitely should!!
